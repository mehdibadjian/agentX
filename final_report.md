3. Regular Audits: Regular audits of the system will help ensure the security measures are functioning as expected and allow us to identify any new potential vulnerabilities.

4. Backup and Disaster Recovery: Create a robust backup and disaster recovery plan to ensure data is not lost in case of a security breach or system failure. This includes regularly backing up data and testing the recovery process to ensure it works correctly.

5. Use of VPNs and Firewalls: Use VPNs for secure remote access and firewalls to prevent unauthorized access to the system.

6. Scalability Testing: Perform scalability testing on a regular basis to ensure the system can handle increased loads and identify any potential issues before they become critical.

7. Microservices Architecture: Consider moving to a microservices architecture, where the application is broken down into smaller, independent services. This architecture can improve scalability as each service can be scaled independently according to its own demand. 

8. Caching: Implement caching strategies to reduce the load on the server and improve response times, which can be particularly beneficial during peak usage times.

9. Auto-scaling: Implement auto-scaling policies that automatically adjust the number of server instances in response to changes in load. This can help ensure the system can handle peaks in demand without over-provisioning resources.

10. Regular Updates: Regularly update and optimize the software and hardware used in the system to ensure they are running as efficiently as possible and can handle increased loads. 

By addressing these areas, we can help ensure our system remains secure and scalable as demand grows.

11. Use of Data Masking Techniques: Protect sensitive data by replacing it with fictional yet realistic data, making it inaccessible for misuse.

12. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Implement 2FA to add an extra layer of security. This requires users to provide two forms of identification before they can access the system.

13. Containerization: Use containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes to package the application with its dependencies. This helps to improve the scalability of the application as it can be easily deployed on any system.

14. Database Sharding: Implement database sharding, a type of database partitioning that separates very large databases into smaller, faster, and more easily managed parts called data shards.

15. CDN (Content Delivery Network): Use a CDN to distribute the load of delivering content. CDNs can reduce bandwidth costs, improve page load times, and increase global availability of services.

16. Use of Intrusion Detection Systems: Implement an intrusion detection system to monitor network traffic and detect suspicious activity that could indicate a security breach.

17. Regular System Monitoring: Keep an eye on the system performance, error logs, and abnormal behavior to proactively address any issue that might arise.

18. Implementing a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA): This can help in improving the scalability of the system as services can be scaled independently.

19. Use of API Management Tools: These tools can help control the usage of APIs which can improve the security and scalability of the system.

20. Vertical and Horizontal Scaling: Depending on the system requirements, apply vertical scaling (adding more power to an existing machine) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines to the network) to improve system scalability.
